## Tips for Success 
**Start simple**: Don't over-engineer initially. Use the basic structure for 2 weeks before customizing. 
**Process Encounters daily**: Don't let the inbox pile up. Process within 24-48 hours. 
**Link while writing**: Create connections as you work, not in a separate "linking session." 
**Use Home as your starting point**: Always begin your day by opening the Home note. 
**Trust the system**: It takes 2-3 weeks to feel natural. Stick with it.
